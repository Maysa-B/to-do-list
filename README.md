### Operation
The most important features of this project are:
1. When writing a task in the `input` field and clicking on the `add` button a new task is added to the list;
2. When we double-click on a task, it is _crossed out_ indicating that it has been performed;
3. By clicking only _once_ on a list element it will be selected changing its `backgroundColor`;
4. We have several buttons with different functionalities, namely:
4.1 ___Limpar___ : deletes all tasks;
4.2 ___Limpar finalizados___ : deletes only the tasks that are concluded;
4.3 ___Salvar___ : saves the current list, including whether the tasks are concluded or not, and their placement;
4.4 ___Remover selecionado___ : deletes only the selected element;
4.5 ___Arrows___ : changes the position of elements in the list.
